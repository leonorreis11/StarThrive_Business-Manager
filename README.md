# StarThrive_Business-Manager
The StarThrive company is responsible for the management of several companies. It is an application to manage the companies managed by StarThrive.

The application, to be used by a StarThrive employee, should allow the production of the lists
and indicators presented below.
1. List of companies managed by StarThrive presenting at least the following information

a. Company name

b. Type of company

c. District

d. Annual expense

e. Annual recipe

f. Profit (yes/no)


2. For each type of company, present the company with the highest annual revenue
(name and value), the company with the lowest annual expense (name and value) and
the company with the highest annual profit (name and profit value).

3. Present the 2 catering companies with the highest number of customers per day.
The interaction with the user must be carried out through a simple JAVA graphical interface
(JFrames) that allows the user to:

a. List, create, edit and delete companies.

b. Present the requested listings and indicators.


The application must be provided with a text file (starthrive.txt) containing data on at least 5
companies of each category in order to demonstrate all the application's features. The
structure of the text file must be defined by the student in order to allow the easy and fast
editing of the file, but also to simplify its parsing by the application. When the application
starts, it must load the companies’ data from the object file (starthrive.dat), and if it does not
exist, load the companies’ data from the text file (starthrive.txt). It should also automatically
save company changes to the object file.
